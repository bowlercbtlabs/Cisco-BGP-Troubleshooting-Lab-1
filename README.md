Trouble Ticket #1 
R1 cannot form an EBGP neighbor relationship with R2. Configure the network so that R1 has established a neighbor relationship with R2. You are only allowed to modify one command on one router to complete this task. Do not delete any configuration. 


Trouble Ticket #2 
After R1 and R2 are able to successfully form an EBGP neighbor relationship, the network 1.1.1.0/24 on R1’s Loopback 0 interface is not being propagated correctly to R2. Configure the network so that network connectivity from R2’s loopback 0 interface (2.2.2.2) can ping R1’s loopback 0 interface (1.1.1.1).
